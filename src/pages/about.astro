        Hi people, I'm <em>Kun Tin</em> or you can call me <em>Kyle</em>ðŸ˜Š
        <br /><br />

        I'm from Macau and was admitted to <em>CityUHK Data Science</em> with
        direct sophomore entry after high school in 2023. Additionally, I'm
        pursuing a minor in <em>Mathematics</em> with a focus on statistics.
        <br /><br />

        Outside coursework, I've also taken part in different
        <em>hackathons, fintech and start-up competitions</em>. Currently, I'm
        a full stack developer intern at <em>UNICEF Hong Kong</em> and am interested in <em>machine learning, UI design and web development</em>.
